# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a part of the Let's Grow More Data Science Internship program. It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris Flower dataset, which is a popular dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three iris species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). For each sample, we have measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Structure
The project repository has the following structure:

- `Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `iris.csv`: The dataset file in CSV format.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- Python
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

# Next Word Prediction

This project is a part of the Let's Grow More Data Science Internship program. It focuses on building a next word prediction model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a large collection of text documents, such as books, articles, or any other textual data. The dataset is preprocessed to extract the necessary information for building the language model.
